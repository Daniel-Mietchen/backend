### What is a Persona? 

In user-centered design, personas are fictional characters created to represent the different user types that might use a site, brand, or product in a similar way. Personas are useful in considering the goals, desires, and limitations of brand buyers and users in order to help to guide decisions about a service, product or interaction space such as features, interactions, and visual design of a website.
