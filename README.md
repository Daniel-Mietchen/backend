#  Open Access Button
========
## Push Button. Get Research. Make Progress.

We all know the frustration of finding the research paper you need, but you can't afford the $40 to access it. The Open Access Button helps you get the research you want right now, and adds papers you still need to your wishlist.

Following the re-launch of the Open Access Button in Open Access Week, we are working hard to build and expand in the coming months. Clear instructions for contributing will follow soon but until then, feel free to check out the Wiki and Issues to see how you can help, or email Joe@openaccessbutton.org.

## Open Access Button Repositories

First of all, we have a few different repos here:

* https://github.com/OAButton/backend
    - This repo is used to discuss backend work. However, openaccessbutton and opendatabutton actually work by using the Cottage Labs API, so there is no functional code in this repo. Any future code specifically required for backend functionality for OAB / ODB could be put here if it cannot go in the CL API.
    - OAB and ODB are the first examples of developing various front-end services that can work entirely via the CL API, saving the need for dedicated backend development and maintenance.
    - The CL API code can be found at https://github.com/CottageLabs/api
* https://github.com/OAButton/oab_static
    - the static site content for https://openaccessbutton.org
* https://github.com/OAButton/odb_static
    - The static site content for https://opendatabutton.org
* https://github.com/OAButton/unified-extension
    - This is where we are developing our new unified extension, for use in chrome and firefox (to become live in Autumn 2016)
* https://github.com/OAButton/oab-fxaddon
    - This is the Firefox addon (soon to be deprecated)
* https://github.com/OAButton/oab-chromeaddon
    - Our Chrome (and Chromium) addon (soon to be deprecated)

## Development

We have decided not to use a general mailing list, and have decided to work through issues here on Github. General queries and issues are best dealt with in the [backend repo](https://github.com/OAButton/backend/issues).
