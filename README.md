#  Open Access Button

## Welcome! 

Hi, welcome to Github. This is where the Open Access Button keeps all it's code, discusses huge amounts of our work & more. It's all openly availiable, and we do it here because we want your help. 

## About the project

The Open Access Button is an app that helps researchers, patients, students and the public get legal access to research they need and request research be made available. Since November 2013, we have made 15,000 requests for research articles and data.

## Getting Started

If you want to help us build the tools, here are some helpful bigs of information! We'll start putting more here soon as it's harder than it should be to dive in and help right now! Let us know what you'd like to see. 

### Ways to contribute

* (Take an hour out of your day give us some feedback on the tool)[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdK3wRKixTVtjn0o8RWvU1MlPPIIKRBsBrHHi6ER_4A3YAmUA/viewform?c=0&w=1&usp=send_form]
* Dive into a (starter issue)[https://github.com/OAButton/backend/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22]
* Take on a (quick fix)[https://github.com/OAButton/backend/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Quick+Fix%22], or (bug)[https://github.com/OAButton/backend/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Quick+Fix%22+label%3Abug]. 

or if you're not interesting in the technical side of things we'd love your help talking to users (potential, new & old) and scheming for how to making things better. 

### Open Access Button Repositories

We have a few different repos here:

* https://github.com/OAButton/backend
    - This repo is used to discuss all technical work. However, open access button works by using the Cottage Labs API, so there is no functional code in this repo.
    - OAB is the first examples of developing various front-end services that can work entirely via the CL API, saving the need for dedicated backend development and maintenance. The CL API code can be found at https://github.com/CottageLabs/api
* https://github.com/OAButton/oab_static
    - the site content for https://openaccessbutton.org
    - you'll find info on editing the site here
* https://github.com/OAButton/unified-extension
    - This is where we have developed our unified extension, for use in chrome and firefox
* https://github.com/OAButton/bookmarklet
    - This is where we have developed our bookmarklet, for use in all good bookmark bars near you. 

* we have other repo's but they're not being actively worked on or supported. 

### Getting in touch

We have decided not to use a general mailing list (because who needs another list?), and have decided to work through issues here on Github. General queries and issues are best dealt with in the [backend repo](https://github.com/OAButton/backend/issues). We use Zenhub for some extra lays of co-ordination Github isn't so good at yet.

### Labels and Milestone crib sheet

What do the various labels/assignments mean for the project?
* Bug: something that isn't working as expected
* Enhancement: a way to improve something
* Question: a question or topic of discussion
* help wanted: we'd love help here! (coming soon: good first bugs)

Assignment to a milestone is confirmation we're planning to do something. Otherwise, we're not currently planning to do much with it and the issue is just there for safe keeping incase one day we do. 

### People

Who are the people you see commonly in this repo at the moment? 

* Joe: Co-founder of the project

* Block Meta-Data: Paper URL, paper metadata, User type, User location associated with a block
