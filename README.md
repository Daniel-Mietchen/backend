#  Open Access Button
========
## Push Button. Get Research. Make Progress.

We all know the frustration of finding the research paper you need, but you can't afford the $40 to access it. The Open Access Button helps you get the research you want right now, and adds papers you still need to your wishlist.

Following the re-launch of the Open Access Button in Open Access Week, we are working hard to build and expand in the coming months. Clear instructions for contributing will follow soon but until then, feel free to check out the Wiki and Issues to see how you can help, or email Joe@openaccessbutton.org.

## This Repository

In this repository you will find the all the code that runs the backend of the Open Access Button. The client-side code can be found in the following repositories.
[Firefox App](https://github.com/OAButton/oab-fxaddon)
[Chrome App](https://github.com/OAButton/oab-chromeaddon)

We are use the wiki for our project management around the technical development of the Open Access Button, although at the moment that is mostly just the minutes from development calls.

## Open Access Button Repositories

First of all, we have a few different repos here:

* https://github.com/OAButton/backend
    - This is the main backend. It includes the code for the website, as well as the database of user stories that we have gathered from people.
    - The other repos connect to this, and act as different front-ends.
* https://github.com/OAButton/oab-fxaddon
    - This is the Firefox addon.
* https://github.com/OAButton/oab-chromeaddon
    - Our Chrome (and Chromium) addon.
* https://github.com/OAButton/OAButton_old
    - This is the old proof of concept bookmarklet and is no longer supported.

## Development

We have decided not to use a general mailing list, and have decided to work through issues here on Github. General queries and issues are best dealt with in the [backend repo](https://github.com/OAButton/backend/issues).
