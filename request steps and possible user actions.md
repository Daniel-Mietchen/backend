# How users can help the Request system

The request system has several stages a request can be in, however, the cycle can cycle through many before ending. For example:

1 Request name, but email is required. State: Email / Target Needed
2 Email Given: Moderation Needed
3 

## Stages

#### Useful things at all stages

* Support the request
* Fill in data about the paper to help with targetting / outreach
 * Title info (if not found)
 * Author name
 * Disipline (if not found) 
 * Funder (if not found) 
 * Publishing date & embargo policy (if not found) 
 * Identify if it should be availiable because of a policy
* Contribute a link to the resource already availiable on the website
* Support the request
* Share the page

### Email / Target Needed

This step looks to find targets (authors or co-authors) for a request and a way to contact them (primarily email). This step may be returned to several times. 

* Look for & provide the email

### Moderation

* Do the moderation (currently done in house)

### Awaiting contact

This is a reccuring step, whenever we try and make contact.

### On Hold

This is where an author has got back to us, but needs time to respond

### Successful

* [Data only] Ensure the dataset given is correct.
