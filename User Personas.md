# Use Personas

This file is still in development. But, if you want to help, go for it. 

## What is a Persona? 

In user-centered design, personas are fictional characters created to represent the different user types that might use a site, brand, or product in a similar way. Personas are useful in considering the goals, desires, and limitations of brand buyers and users in order to help to guide decisions about a service, product or interaction space such as features, interactions, and visual design of a website. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(user_experience)(Wikipedia)

## Making our Personas 

A user persona is a representation of the goals and behavior of a hypothesized group of users. In most cases, personas are synthesized from data collected from interviews with users. They are captured in 1â€“2-page descriptions that include behavior patterns, goals, skills, attitudes, and the environment, with a few fictional personal details to make the persona a realistic character. For each product, more than one persona is usually created, but one persona should always be the primary focus for the design.

### Notes

* we probably want between 3-5
- [ ] Should talk to some users in developing these, or we can just guess and then adjust with user feedback
* rough breakdown may be student / researcher with access / researcher without access / ??? / ??? 
* don't think we need these to be over a page, more like a paragraph to start would be fine. 
- [ ] Need some fake people images

None of these names are in any way just the names of cats I've live with at points in time. No sir.
