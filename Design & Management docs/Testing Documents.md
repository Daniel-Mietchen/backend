# Testing Documents

It's easier to work on these documents in Gdocs, so, just linking out to critical documents from here.

## [Technical Testing Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zp-sf_JqNMw8keXD11pnTGUOqbGf-7QZugNrxPo-7AA/edit#heading=h.guw6ewp66enx)

This guide provides some simple links & tests to run on various parts of our infrastructure. Useful for testing the find system.

Note, a guide on "Testing States" has also been produced but could do with being rolled into the above: https://github.com/OAButton/discussion/blob/master/Testing%20States.md
